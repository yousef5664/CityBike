## Summary of Findings 

In the exploration, I found that summer months have more trips and long trip durations than winter months. Trips shows that some people rely on bike trips to go and raturn back from their work,  However these trips tend to be less duration than weekends. This means people could rely on bike to go to work if their work is close enough.
