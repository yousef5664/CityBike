The Dataset contains over 17 million trips for year 2018. It has 
trip-duration, start-startion, end-station, uesr-type, birth-year and gender variables.

## Summary of Findings 

In the exploration, I found that summer months have more trips and long trip durations than winter months. Trips shows that some people rely on bike trips to go and raturn back from their work,  However these trips tend to be less duration than weekends. This means people could rely on bike to go to work if their work is close enough.

## Key Insights 
There are over 17 million trips made in 2018. Most of the trips taken by male with 68% and trips taken by Female are 23% The other 8% is known gender. Subscribers taken 89% of trips and Customers taken 11%. Before I started the exploration, I asked two qutions And I found their answers.

### In order to predict future number of trips, What variables effect the number of trips?
The time is import to predict the number of trips will be made. There is a peak from May to October. And there is more trips during business days than weekends. It is clear that business days has two spikes first one at 7-8 and another one at 17-18. The weekends has wide range spike form 10-19.

### Does the trip duration has any correlation with other variables ?
Yes, Time is really import to predict the the durtion of trips. We saw that from April to August have longer trips. Trips taken on weekends are longer than business days.
